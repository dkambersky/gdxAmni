Amniora 
========

A repo for the Amniora Game project. 
----------
This is more of a solo project, for a programming class I'm currently taking under the CAS programme.

Initally created by xCabbage 	[https://github.com/xcabbage].

Concept:
----------

- a RTS-esque game on a planet
- build structures, armies, expand your territory [Soonâ„¢ :D]
- should involve techtrees
- hopefully once multiplayer [June: HA. HA. HA. HA]

Written in Java; implementing LibGDX & TheEnigmaBlade's Roit API
